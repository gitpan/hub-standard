<p>hubuse - Using the Hub library</p>
<p>
<a href="#__index__"><small>Top</small></a>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<p>The Hub module represents functions and classes which are implemented in 
descendant packages.  Hub dynamically loads modules according to the parameters
it is <em>use</em>d with.</p>
<p>
<a href="#__index__"><small>Top</small></a>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>Don't use the underlying modules directly:</p>
<pre>
  use Hub::Base::FileSystem;    # Wrong
  use Hub;                      # Correct</pre>
<pre>
  my $parser = Hub::Parse::FileParser-&gt;new('my.template');    # Wrong
  my $parser = Hub::mkinst('FileParser', 'my.template');      # Correct</pre>
<p>Without getting into gory detail, this non-standard approach is in place for
three reasons:</p>
<pre>
  1)  Allow the library to be refactored (maintained) without impacting existing
      code.</pre>
<pre>
  2)  We don't want to short-circut Perl's built-in require functionality which
      would be necessary, were we to support direct underlying module usage.</pre>
<pre>
  3)  We only want to load underlying modules when they are needed.  We want to
      group related modules in the same subdirectory. The subdirectory name 
      will then be used as the import tag which loads its modules.</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="module_directory_structure">Module Directory Structure</a></h2>
<p>By default, Hub tries to be as efficient as possible, only loading packages
which are necessary.</p>
<p>Subdirectories are used to group exported modules.  Underneath the
root (Hub) directory, are sub-directories which represent the export tag
of which the underlying modules should be represented.</p>
<pre>
    Hub/:
      |-Base/:
      |-Util/:
      `-Webapp/:</pre>
<p>Descendant packages maintain their exported symbols in their EXPORT_OK array.
The Hub module proxies these exported symbols, thus requiring all descendant-
exported symbols to be unique.</p>
<p>Classes are created with the Hub::mkinst using their short-name.  Thus
requiring them to be unique (to other classes):</p>
<pre>
  1. Hub::Custom::Class.pm       # defines function 'new'
  2. Hub::Another::Class.pm      # doesn't define 'new'
  3. Hub::Yetagain::Class.pm     # also defines 'new'</pre>
<p>#1 and #3 will clash because they are both classes, but either can be used
with #2 simultaneously.</p>
