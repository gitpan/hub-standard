=head1 NAME

Hub::Data::File - File


=head1 SYNOPSIS


  use Hub qw(:standard);
  my $file = mkinst('File', 'foo.txt');
  print ${$file->get_content()};



=head1 DESCRIPTION


A basic file which can be written and saved.  It acts as a singleton
and is integrated into the filecache system (supports refresh).

=head2 Intention

The L<FileSystem::snapshot> method creates an image of the file
system.  Each file is an instance of this class.  We delay reading from disk
until it is necessary.  We do not keep a file handle open.
